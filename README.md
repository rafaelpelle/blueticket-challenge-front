> **IMPORTANT:** The HG Finance API require a access key (previously registered) to allow CORS. The key is binded to a domain and only requests made from that domain will be allowed by the API. By default this project uses a key binded to the domain https://blueticket-challenge.netlify.com (my deployment URL). If you want to use a different key, please insert it as a environment variable in a `.env` file. Example: `FINANCE_KEY=abcd1234`
